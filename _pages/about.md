I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and Technology at University of Science and Technology of China. I am very fortunate to be advised by professor [Xiang-yang Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xiangyangli/) and professor [Lan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=83QxmA8AAAAJ&hl=en). 
We work on mobile computing, human interaction, and GIS management. 
I recieved my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology from the Special Class for the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China in 2018.
