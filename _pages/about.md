I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and Technology at University of Science and Technology of China. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiang-yang Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xiangyangli/) and Prof. [Lan Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=83QxmA8AAAAJ&hl=en). 
My research interests include *mobile computing and human-computer interaction*. 
I recieved my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology from *the Special Class for the Gifted Young*, University of Science and Technology of China in 2018.
